## Quick Start

### Basic Structure

```
Title: Your Adventure Name
Author: Your Name
Description: A brief description of your adventure
Initial SKILL: 8
Initial STAMINA: 20
Initial LUCK: 9

Section 1: The Beginning

You stand at the entrance to a dark forest. A worn sign reads "Danger Ahead!"

## Format Overview

The app supports multiple formats:

- **TXT** (`.txt`) - Plain text, easiest to write
- **MD** (`.md`) - Markdown format
- **JSON** (`.json`) - Structured data for advanced features
- **PDF** (`.pdf`) - Automatically converted to text

### Recommended: Start with TXT

Write your adventure in plain text format. It's the easiest to create and can be converted to JSON later.

---

## Metadata

Add metadata at the beginning of your file:

### Required

```
Title: Your Adventure Name
```

### Optional but Recommended

```
Author: Your Name
Description: A short description of your adventure
Initial SKILL: 8
Initial STAMINA: 20
Initial LUCK: 9
```

**Default Stats** (if not specified):
- SKILL: 6
- STAMINA: 14
- LUCK: 6

---

## Sections

Sections are the building blocks of your adventure. Each section has:
- An ID number
- Content/narrative text
- Choices (where to go next)

### Section Format Options

The app recognizes several formats. **You can mix different formats in the same file!**

#### Option 1: Plain Format (Most Flexible) ⭐
```
Section 1
Section 1:
Section 1.
SECTION 1
```
**Note:** Colons and punctuation are **completely optional**! Both `Section 1` and `Section 1:` work perfectly.

#### Option 2: Markdown Headers ⭐ NEW
```
## SECTION 1
## SECTION 1 {#section-1}
### Section 1
# SECTION 1 {#section-1}
```
- Any number of `#` symbols works
- Anchor tags `{#...}` are optional
- Perfect for markdown documents
- Case-insensitive (SECTION or Section)

#### Option 3: Brackets
```
[1]
[1] The Dark Cave
```

#### Option 4: Number with period
```
1.
1. The Dark Cave
```

#### Option 5: Parentheses
```
(1)
(1) The Dark Cave
```

#### Option 6: Markdown Bold
```
**1**
```

#### Option 7: Standalone number
```
1
```

### Special Sections

- **Section 0**: Introduction/background (optional, shown before game starts)
- **Section 1**: Starting section (required, where the game begins)
- **Section 999**: Traditional death/failure ending

### Section Example

```
Section 5: The Treasure Room

You enter a magnificent chamber filled with gold and jewels.
In the center sits a ornate chest.

If you want to open the chest, turn to 10.
If you want to leave the room, go to 3.
```

---

## Choices

Choices let players navigate between sections.

### Supported Choice Formats

#### Format 1: Traditional Text Choices
The app recognizes these choice phrases:

- `turn to X`
- `go to X`
- `proceed to X`
- `continue to X`
- `move to X`
- `head to X`
- `return to X`

**Examples:**
```
If you want to fight, turn to 15.
To run away, go to 8.
You may proceed to section 20.
Continue to 5 if you have a key.
```

#### Format 2: Markdown Link Choices ⭐ NEW
Use markdown link format for clickable choices:

```
[45](#section-45)
[127](#section-127)
```

**With descriptive text:**
```
Turn to [45](#section-45) to enter the Weeping Willow tavern
Turn to [127](#section-127) to investigate the cemetery
Turn to [234](#section-234) to visit Mayor Hollow's manor
```

This format is perfect for markdown documents and provides clickable links in markdown viewers.

#### Format 3: Mixed Formats
You can even mix both styles in the same adventure:

```
Section 10

You stand at a crossroads.

If you go left, turn to 5.
Go right: [15](#section-15)
Or return to [1](#section-1)
```

### Best Practices

- **1-4 choices per section** is ideal for gameplay
- Make choices clear and meaningful
- Every section should have at least one choice (unless it's an ending)
- Both traditional and markdown link formats work equally well

---

## Combat

Add combat encounters using this format:

```
ENEMY_NAME SKILL X STAMINA Y
```

### Examples

```
A GOBLIN attacks! SKILL 6 STAMINA 8

The DRAGON roars! SKILL 12 STAMINA 20

An ORC WARRIOR charges at you! SKILL 8 STAMINA 10
```

### Combat Section Example

```
Section 7: The Arena

You step into the arena. A massive TROLL appears! SKILL 9 STAMINA 15

If you defeat the troll, turn to 12.
```

### Combat Notes

- Enemy name should be in CAPITAL LETTERS
- Always include a victory section (where to go after winning)
- If the player loses, they automatically go to section 999 (death)

---

## Advanced Features

### Endings

The app automatically detects endings:

#### Detected by Section Number
- Section 999 = Death/Defeat
- Section 400 = Alternate ending

#### Detected by Keywords
The following phrases mark a section as an ending:
- "you have won"
- "victory"
- "you have succeeded"
- "the end"
- "you have died"
- "you are dead"
- "game over"

### Ending Types

- **Victory**: Player wins
- **Defeat**: Player loses/dies
- **Neutral**: Ambiguous or alternate ending

### Example Endings

```
Section 100: Victory!

You have won! The kingdom is saved and you are hailed as a hero.

---

Section 999: Defeat

You have died. Your quest ends in failure.
```

### Stat Modifications (Text Format)

You can modify player stats in your narrative:

```
You drink the potion. Restore 4 STAMINA points.

The trap injures you. Lose 2 STAMINA.

Your training pays off. Add 1 to your SKILL.
```

### Items (JSON Format Only)

For item management, use JSON format:

```json
{
  "id": 5,
  "text": "You find a healing potion!",
  "addItems": [
    {
      "id": "healing-potion",
      "name": "Healing Potion",
      "description": "Restores 4 STAMINA points",
      "type": "potion"
    }
  ]
}
```

Item types: `weapon`, `armor`, `potion`, `treasure`, `key`, `other`

### Luck Tests (JSON Format Only)

```json
{
  "id": 10,
  "text": "You attempt to jump across the chasm. Test your luck!",
  "testLuck": {
    "successSection": 15,
    "failureSection": 999,
    "successText": "You make it across safely!",
    "failureText": "You fall into the darkness..."
  }
}
```

## Using the Formatter Tool

### Command Line Tool

The CLI tool helps validate and convert your adventures.

#### Installation

The tool is located at `formatAdventure.js` and uses Node.js.

#### Commands

**1. Validate your adventure:**
```bash
node formatAdventure.js validate my-adventure.txt
```

This checks for:
- Missing metadata
- Duplicate sections
- Broken links (choices pointing to non-existent sections)
- Unreachable sections
- Dead ends (sections without choices)

**2. Convert TXT to JSON:**
```bash
node formatAdventure.js convert my-adventure.txt
```

Or specify output file:
```bash
node formatAdventure.js convert my-adventure.txt output.json
```

**3. Check for common issues:**
```bash
node formatAdventure.js check my-adventure.txt
```

This identifies:
- Section numbering gaps
- Very short sections
- Sections with too many choices
- Combat without clear victory paths

### What the Validator Checks

✅ **Passes if:**
- Has a title
- Has at least one section
- Has section 1 (starting point)
- No duplicate section numbers
- All choice references point to existing sections

⚠️ **Warnings for:**
- Missing author
- Unreachable sections
- Dead ends (sections without choices that aren't endings)
- Large section numbering gaps

❌ **Fails if:**
- Missing title
- No sections found
- Missing section 1
- Duplicate section numbers
- Broken links (choices to non-existent sections)

## Tips for Writing Great Adventures

3. **Number wisely** - Leave gaps (1, 5, 10, 15...) for easy additions
4. **Test thoroughly** - Use the validator to check for issues

### Gameplay
1. **Balance choices** - 2-4 options per section is ideal
2. **Vary difficulty** - Mix easy and hard combat encounters
3. **Multiple paths** - Create different ways to reach endings

### Endings
1. **Multiple endings** - Victory, defeat, and alternate endings
2. **Clear outcomes** - Use victory/defeat keywords
