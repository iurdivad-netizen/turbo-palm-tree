## 📝 Creating Custom Adventures

Adventures can be created in **four different formats**: JSON, TXT, Markdown, or PDF.

### Quick Start - Text Format (Easiest!)

Create a simple text file:

```
Title: My Adventure
Author: Your Name
Initial SKILL: 8
Initial STAMINA: 20
Initial LUCK: 9

Section 1: The Beginning

Your adventure starts here. Write your narrative text.

If you want to go left, turn to 2.
If you want to go right, turn to 3.

Section 2: Left Path

You went left and found a GOBLIN! SKILL 5 STAMINA 6

If you defeat it, turn to 4.

Section 3: Right Path

You went right. Continue your story here. Turn to 4.

Section 4: The End

You completed the adventure! You have won!
```

The parser automatically:
- ✅ Detects section numbers
- ✅ Creates choices from "turn to" references
- ✅ Parses combat from "SKILL X STAMINA Y" patterns
- ✅ Identifies endings

**📖 See `FORMAT-GUIDE.md` for complete documentation on all formats!**

### JSON Format (Advanced Control)

JSON format gives you complete control over all game features.

#### Book Structure

```json
{
  "id": "unique-adventure-id",
  "title": "Your Adventure Title",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "description": "A brief description of your adventure",
  "startingSection": 1,
  "initialStats": {
    "skill": 8,
    "stamina": 20,
    "luck": 9
  },
  "startingItems": [
    {
      "id": "sword",
      "name": "Iron Sword",
      "description": "Your trusty blade",
      "type": "weapon"
    }
  ],
  "sections": [...]
}
```

#### Section Structure

Each section can have:

- **Basic Info**: `id`, `title`, `text`
- **Choices**: Array of choices with `text`, `targetSection`, and optional `conditions`
- **Combat**: Enemy encounters with stats and outcomes
- **Test Your Luck**: Luck-based challenges with success/failure paths
- **Items**: `addItems` and `removeItems` arrays
- **Stat Changes**: `modifyStats` object for skill/stamina/luck changes
- **Endings**: `isEnding` and `endingType` (victory/defeat/neutral)

#### Example Section with Combat

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "title": "Forest Encounter",
  "text": "A goblin jumps out from behind a tree!",
  "combat": {
    "enemyName": "Goblin",
    "enemySkill": 5,
    "enemyStamina": 6,
    "onVictorySection": 3,
    "onDefeatSection": 99,
    "canFlee": true,
    "fleeSection": 1
  }
}
```

#### Example Section with Choices

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "The Crossroads",
  "text": "You come to a fork in the road.",
  "choices": [
    {
      "text": "Go left",
      "targetSection": 2
    },
    {
      "text": "Go right (requires key)",
      "targetSection": 3,
      "conditions": {
        "requiresItem": "rusty-key"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Item Types

- `weapon` - ⚔️ Weapons
- `armor` - 🛡️ Armor and shields
- `potion` - 🧪 Potions and consumables
- `treasure` - 💎 Gold and valuables
- `key` - 🔑 Keys and access items
- `other` - 📦 Miscellaneous items

#### Conditional Choices

Choices can require:
- `requiresItem`: Specific item ID
- `requiresMinSkill`: Minimum SKILL value
- `requiresMinStamina`: Minimum STAMINA value
- `requiresMinLuck`: Minimum LUCK value

## 🎲 Game Mechanics

### Combat System
1. Both combatants roll 2 dice
2. Add SKILL to dice roll for Attack Strength
3. Higher Attack Strength wins the round
4. Loser takes 2 STAMINA damage
5. Combat continues until one reaches 0 STAMINA

### Test Your Luck
- Roll 2 dice
- Success if roll ≤ current LUCK
- LUCK decreases by 1 after each test

### Stats
- **SKILL**: Combat effectiveness (doesn't change often)
- **STAMINA**: Health points (0 = death)
- **LUCK**: Success in luck tests (decreases with use)

## 🌐 Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Opera (latest)

## 📱 Mobile Support

The app is responsive and works on mobile devices, though desktop provides the best experience.

## 💾 Save System

- Saves are stored in browser localStorage
- Each save includes full game state

## 🎨 Customization

The HTML file is fully self-contained. You can easily customize:
- Colors and styling (edit the `<style>` section)

- UI layout (edit the render functions)

## 📖 Example Adventures

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**"Could not load example book" error:**
- Make sure example files are in the same directory as `index.html`
- Check that JSON files have valid JSON syntax
- For text files, ensure sections are numbered correctly

**"Could not parse adventure" error:**
- Check that your text file has clear section headers (Section 1:, Section 2:, etc.)
- Ensure you have at least one section
- See `FORMAT-GUIDE.md` for correct format

**Choices are grayed out:**
- You don't meet the requirements (check your stats or inventory)

**Combat not working:**
- Make sure your STAMINA is above 0
- In text files, use exact format: "SKILL X STAMINA Y"
- Try refreshing the page

**PDF not loading:**
- Ensure text is selectable (not scanned images)
- PDF must contain text in a parseable format
- Try converting to TXT format first
